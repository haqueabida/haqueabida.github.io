excerpt: 'Ring signatures allow a user to sign anonymously on behalf of a set (the so-called ring). Usually, the larger the ring size, the larger the signature, making ring signatures less practical for real-world usage. While there is work on compact (i.e., polylogarithmic or better) signature sizes, less attention has been paid to traceable ring signatures, wherein a signer can only sign once without their identity being revealed.
 We show a compact traceable ring signature scheme.   We compare our work to the current state-of-the-art, namely, that of Feng et al.[FLL+21].
Although our traceable ring signature 
uses similar building blocks to Feng et al.'s, we have a very different technique for achieving traceability. In particular, we leverage the special soundness of Sigma-protocols.In this paper, we provide the first definition of t-out-of-N threshold ring signatures against <em>active<\em> adversaries who can participate in the system and arbitrarily deviate from the prescribed procedures. Second, we present a post-quantum secure realization based on  <em>any<\em> (post-quantum secure) trapdoor commitment, which we prove secure in the QROM. Our construction is black-box and it can be instantiated with any trapdoor commitment, thus allowing the use of a variety of hardness assumptions.'
