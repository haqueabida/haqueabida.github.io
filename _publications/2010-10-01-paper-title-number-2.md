excerpt: '
A recent line of work, Stacked Garbled Circuit (SGC), showed that Garbled Circuit (GC) can be improved for functions that include exclusive conditional behavior.
SGC relieves the communication bottleneck of 2PC by only sending enough garbled material for a single branch out of the $b$ total branches.  
Hence, communication is sublinear in the total circuit size.
However, both the evaluator and the generator 
must pay in computation and perform at least factor   $\log b$ {\em extra} work as compared to standard GC evaluation. '
