excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide the first definition of t-out-of-N threshold ring signatures against <em>active<\em> adversaries who can participate in the system and arbitrarily deviate from the prescribed procedures. Second, we present a post-quantum secure realization based on  <em>any<\em> (post-quantum secure) trapdoor commitment, which we prove secure in the QROM. Our construction is black-box and it can be instantiated with any trapdoor commitment, thus allowing the use of a variety of hardness assumptions.'
