This is the page of Abida Haque. 

As a recent PhD graduate in computer science, my research interests focus on cryptography, specifically managing user anonymity, decentralizing trust, and identifying gaps in current cryptographic schemes. My work includes improving security definitions for ring and group signatures, and working on multi-party computation. I am committed to making computation safe for individuals to participate in online platforms. In my teaching, I inspire students to become stewards of their own digital safety and privacy.
