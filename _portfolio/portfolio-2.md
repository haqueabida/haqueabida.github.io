title: "Secure (Secret-Shared) Merge Explainer"
excerpt: "Setting: Two parties P1 and P2 have lists A and B; both A and B are sorted. They want to merge the two lists A and B into a new list Arr so the result is still sorted. They don’t want to share their information, though, and they don’t want to do the computation themselves, so they delegate it.
They secret-share A and B (still in sorted order!) among n helpers H1, H2, H3, up to Hn. <br/><img src='/images/3953273590_704e3899d5_m.jpg'>"
